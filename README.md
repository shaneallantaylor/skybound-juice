## Build Process :wrench:
This mock-up was built with HTML5, CSS, and jQuery. My process for rapidly building a page mock-up is to first write all of the HTML in the structure I think will be used in the final build. Next up is a first pass at the CSS needed to display all the content correctly. I prefer to write CSS in the mobile-first approach - media breakpoints are much more intuitive when writing CSS for mobile first. It is also very easy to add unnecessary bloat to your CSS files when styling for desktop in the beginning. With no mobile comps provided here, I stuck with a desktop styling. I stuck with 100% hand-written styles because it's more fun to figure out solutions in the context of these types of technical demonstrations. However, there are a number of wonderful CSS frameworks that would speed up the styling process (I like Materialize, Foundation, and Bootstrap). Finally, I was able to get to a minor amount of interactivity for the main navigation menu with jQuery.

## What I Wasn't Able to Finish :construction:
* Mobile responsiveness :no_mobile_phones:
  * In the context of the timeline provided, I styled a lot of elements using an approach that is quick-and-dirty and **horrid** for extensibility and responsiveness - [**__Magic Numbers__**](https://css-tricks.com/magic-numbers-in-css/)
  * The mock-up falls to its knees below a view-width of 1200px!
  * I would work on creating mobile designs and construct the page based on those first (I have a few years of experience with Photoshop for wireframes and web designs and a little more than a year of experience with Adobe XD for wireframes)
* Implementing styles beyond the 'Buy the box' section :eyes:
* A cleaner implementation of the sub-menu interaction :hand:
* The actual DIN typeface - I'm using an alternative to the original typeface and it's not the worst, but it only comes in one font-weight :thumbsdown:
* Description and keywords in the meta tags for improved SEO :chart_with_upwards_trend:
  * While descriptions and keywords in meta tags are not nearly as heavily weighted as was once thought, they are still important to have!
* Custom default images and text for social media preview windows  (this is done in meta tags as well!) :sunglasses:

### Conclusion
I had fun working on this technical demo! It's been a while since I've rolled my own implementation of drop-down menus, so I went for that as well. 

#### Cheers!
